          The term <strong>"Star"</strong> that makes me feel a zillion things when I think about it. This make me wonder, happy, excited and 
          all the other positive emotions one could possibly imagine.
          <br> <br>
          From making me think when star makes element like hydrogen to making something so simple as <strong> Scrunchies</strong> for humans. <br>
          From fusing heavier atoms like oxygen inside the core of a star to making tea leaves and a cup so it might fall unexpectedly. <br>
          From making Neutron-star to complex protein for humans. <br>
          From making Black-hole to making Wanted movie scene dialogue "Iss dabbe mai <strong>PASTA</strong> hi hoga". <br>
          From making Earth to making a human who will live on it. <br>
          From making Solar System to making my brain, where neuron are spiking and I'm chuckling thinking about this. <strong> Humour 80% TARS. </strong>

          The Kendrick's joints or J.B's Cold Water, Stay, and Ems and also Hans medleys. I'm gonna do the same, repose myself and listen to this songs 
          on a loop
           today and yeah with gratitude I will enjoy the
           stellar formation day, when stardust coalesced and made a wonderful person like you.</p> <br>
          <p>
          I could've written a long text but I'm emiting on all wavelength but nothing is going through.<br>
          Its nothing just TARS in teserract telling this to Cooper.
          He replies to TARS... huh think think. We have to figure something out.
          TARS insightfully responded "Cooper they didn't brought us here.
          He will ask again and TARS will reiterate again. 
          Finally Cooper realized it. These are some dialogue of the most loveable movie of mine, 
          If you have seen the movie you will understand the
           connotation, you surely will like it. Why the heck I'm speaking about my likes. Anyways.

            For some, you are star that gives light, for some you are a fire that need to be feared,
            for some you are as composed as stagnant water, for some a wave of an ocean, for some an inspiration, for some a convoluted and for some a simple person
            and more of mystery that I do not know, but above all, <strong> You are a Timeless entity resembling 
            a human body. </strong>

           A person tells another... 
          Hi there, I want to ask, why sometimes people do things that hard to explain?. Yeah true... replied the
           second person further continuing its hard to say but for understanding the 
          thing we need to shift the paradigm that's the most important aspect, I guess. (Bailey nodding his head while listening.) We humans are distinguished by our different 
          thinking. And  we are oblivious that we're susceptible to the environment that shapes us whether watching other people,
           watching endless junk media, and last but not least the very thinking and heart we have. And humans have general
           propensity toward negative, the natural path in today's world. Someone said "khud ke assumption". Yeah thats what 
           everyone does. But there's beyond the view of "What they say". So think again by Adam Grant oh I switched the conversation lol. It was getting boring, instead I would like 
           say what people don't know.
           "How many times I need to tell to the people Sun is actually a Star". "TARS" is anagram of "Star" who's a robot in Interstellar such a clever masterpiece it is.
           Btw people never watch the full movie beacuse half of the time they blink their eyes. I laughed when i realized that. Realized Soul 
           I'm gonna go now.
