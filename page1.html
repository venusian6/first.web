          The term that makes me feel a zillion things when i think about it. This make me wonder, happy, excited and 
          all the other positive emotions one could possibly imagine.
          <br> <br>
          From making element like hydrogen to making something so simple as scrunchies for human. <br>
          From fusing heavier atoms like oxygen inside star core to make tea and a cup so it might fall unexpectedly. <br>
          From making neutron-star to making protein for humans. <br>
          From making black-hole to making Wanted movie scene dialogue "Iss dabbe mai <strong>PASTA</strong> hi hoga". <br>
          From making earth to making a human who will live on it <br>
          From making solar system to making my brain where neuron are spiking and I'm chuckling thinking about this. <strong> Humour 80% TARS </strong>

          I could've written a long text but I'm emiting on all wavelength but nothing is going through.<br>
          Its nothing just TARS in teserract telling this to Cooper.
          He replies to TARS... huh think think. We have to figure something out.
          TARS insightfully responded "Cooper they didn't brought us here.
          He will ask again and TARS will reiterate again. 
          Finally Cooper realized it. Above are some dialogue of the most loveable movie, If you have seen the movie you will understand the
           connotation you will surely like it. Why the heck I'm spilling about me. Anyways.
            I could have written tons but ahh hope
          its not cringy.

          Hi there, I want to ask why it's hard to make people understand? Yeah said the second person its hard.... But for understanding the 
          thing we need to shift the paradigm that's the most important aspect. We humans are distinguished by our different 
          thinking. And as you are aware we are susceptible to the environment that shapes us whether watching other people,
           watching endless junk media, and last but not least the very thinking and heart we have. And, generally, humans have 
          a propensity to lean toward the worse, the natural path in today's world. Someone said "khud ke assumption". Yeah thats what 
           everyone does. So think again by adam grant oh i switched the conversation lol. Its getting boring instead i would like to write the
           choactic quote you wrote.

        <strong><p class="programmer" style="color: black; font-size: 25px;">What people might think is ugly I find it a peculiar amazing
