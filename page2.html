      <p><br> looks and the right sided hair, the scrunchies, the labradors, the freaking atom and their omnipresence nature okay ahhh you see it
       I,m gonna skip all the details <br>
      I'm gonna chill today with listening firstly "Something just like you" and
      sky full of stars, scientist
      <br />Ahh memories by maroon 5 and Maps<br />
      coldplay is beast <br />scientist and la la vida opus magnus I m gonna
      repose myself and listen this songs on loop today and yea with gratitude i
      will enjoy the stellar formation day of the wonderful person. I could've
      have wrote a long text but I'm emiting on all wavelength but nothing is
      going through.<br>
      Its nothing just CASE in teserract telling this to Cooper.<br>
      Cooper saying back to robot... huh think think. We have to figure
      something out.<br>
      CASE insightfully responded "Cooper they didn't brought us
      here.<br>
      We brought ourself He will ask again and CASE will reiterate again<br.>
      Finally cooper realized it. I...shutter Hope you are still reading
      <br>. I
      never will know that you will close it or read any further. Honestly i
      don't think that way its my reverence doesn't matter if you take in
      different context. Above are some dialogue of the most loveable movie, so
      much that after almost 9 year it got released again i didn't missed a
      chance to see. If you understand the connotation you will surely like it.
      Tonight star will shine twice as they used too just to make your presence
      definable among other star. Its the harbinger of another star being born.
